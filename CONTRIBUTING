## Getting Involved

I am acutely aware that as a professionally trained Accountant I may have used some conventions, definitions and styles that while seemingly obvious to me, might not be so clear to another developer. I would therefore welcome and greatly appreciate any feedback on the ease of use of the package so I can make it more useful to as many people as possible.
